I"‘<p>Easy Linux box from HackTheBox.</p>

<p>On rustscan we found It has 3 ports open 21,22,80.</p>

<p>first tried to use filezilla to login ftp but couldnâ€™t.

I needed credentials to login ftp.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s Enumerate webpage. I found itâ€™s giving packets.

<p>Letâ€™s try to check data packet 0.
using wireshark.
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210614120303.png" alt="Pasted image 20210614120303.png" />
we got credentials.
user <strong>Nathan</strong> 
password <strong>Buck3tH4TF0RM3!</strong> 
We can ssh and ftp using these creds.
on doing ssh we get #user-txt</p>

<p>For root priv letâ€™s run linpeas.sh
We found that python has capabillity to setuid as 0.</p>

<p>so run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/sh")'</code></p>

<p>and we get root shell and finally #root-txt</p>
