I"ê	<p>Easy Linux box from HackTheBox.</p>

<p>Starting with port scanning.
let‚Äôs use rustscan.
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210603125017.png" alt="Pasted image 20210603125017.png" />
It has 2 ports open 22 and 5000.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs visit port 5000.
Webpage give three functionality.</p>
<ul>
  <li>port scanning</li>
  <li>msf payload generator</li>
  <li>sploit search</li>
</ul>

<p>On, searching of msfvenom exploit we found apk template injection.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs generate reverse shell payload using msfconsole.
open up msfconsole and search msfvenom.

let‚Äôs use it.
set your lhost and lport and then run.</p>

<p>We got exploit let‚Äôs try to upload it on payload page.

It give us a reverse shell.
and make it stable using python tty command.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'</code></p>

<p>We found the user.txt in kid‚Äôs directory.</p>

<p>On enumeration we found that there is a file scanlosers.sh that is running every time.
let‚Äôs read scanlosers.sh
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210603132011.png" alt="Pasted image 20210603132011.png" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs reading from a hackers file which is in kid‚Äôs logs directory and we have permission to write on this file.
Let‚Äôs copy code on your machine to get exploit.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs try to edit a file in such a way that we can get reverse shell.
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210603132636.png" alt="Pasted image 20210603132636.png" />
testing on my machine i found that it‚Äôs ignoring first two written words.
so i tried to edit hackers file so i can get reverse shell using nc.</p>

<p>Edited hackers file with this :
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210603145816.png" alt="Pasted image 20210603145816.png" /></p>

<p>when i saved this file i got reverse shell as pwn user.</p>

<p>On, checking sudo -l , I found that metasploit can be run as root without password.
<img src="assets/images/Pasted image 20210603150149.png" alt="Pasted image 20210603150149.png" /></p>

<p>run:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo msfconsole</code></p>

<p>then run:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code>
and we got root shell.
Now, we can cat /root/root.txt</p>
