It request our python server for some files.
we used this exploit to send reverse shell.
[https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload](https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload)
using this we get shell of tomcat.

It's running on tomcat so let's find it configuration.
reading tomcat config file we get credentials
``admin:whythereisalimit``

After doing ssh we are now admin user.
we get #user-txt 

after checking sudo -l.<br>
we find that we can run sudo with index.go without password.<br>
if we check file index.go we see that path is not properly specified completely for main.wasm and deploy.sh.

Let's create main.wasm which returns 1 as a value of info function
using [https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/](https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/)

In deploy.sh let's put a reverse shell.
We got a reverse shell as a root user
we got #root-txt
